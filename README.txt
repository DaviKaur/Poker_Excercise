If using Linux System, requirements are to have any editor. In my case I am using Vim editor.

To run the code, please follow the following steps:

1. Clone the git code using command "$git clone "https://github.com/DaviKaur/Poker_Excercise.git"

2. Give executable permissions - $sudo chmod +x

3.  poker.py contains the code and poker-hands.txt contains the data

4. Run the code using command "$python3 poker.py poker-hands.txt"

5. Check the output.
